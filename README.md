# Steganography

I used Python 3.6 for this project.  I don't think my logic for encode is entirely correct, because when I decode it there are some garbage characters.  I had somewhat of a difficult time trying to manipulate the bits.  I know definitely that decode works.  

To run encode, you need to specify the name of the text file we will encode in the image.  You also need to specify the original image.  

To run decode, you need to specify the name of the image to decode.
